# CONTEXT

_Staging buffer for in-flight design decisions (grill-with-docs). Once a
decision is implemented, promote it into its domain guide under `docs/feature/`
(the single source of truth for **how** the thing works) and — when the
alternatives rejected are worth preserving — into an ADR under `docs/adr/`
(the record of **why**). Then clear it from here; this file is never the
permanent record. See `docs/adr/README.md` for the promotion flow._

_No decisions in flight._

Last cleared 2026-08-04. Everything staged here has been promoted:

| Was staged | How it works | Why |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| Clicking into a cut selects invisible geometry | `bim-viewer.md` § Picking (clip-aware raycasting) | [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-clip-aware-raycaster.md) |
| Measure cursors become their own components | `bim-viewer.md` § Measure tools, § Cursor-family constructor typing | — (no lasting rejected alternative) |
| Measure lag: snapping moves to the FRAGS worker | `bim-viewer.md` § Measure tools → Vertex snapping | [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-worker-side-snapping-over-cpu-picking-meshes.md) |
| Cursor-bounded navigation + the pivot dot | `bim-viewer.md` § Camera navigation, § The pivot dot | [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-cursor-bounded-navigation.md) |
| Section box | `bim-viewer.md` § Section box, § GizmoAxis · `bim-viewport-toolbars.md` right rail | [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-section-box-outside-clipper.md) |
| Zoom dies once the camera parks | `bim-viewer.md` § Camera navigation | [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-zoom-pivot-reanchor.md) |

⚠️ **One block was deliberately *not* promoted.** The former navigation entry carried a
"Correction" section (items 18–23) proposing that the click-pivot be deleted and the clamp
released on `rest`. It was **never implemented** — verified against `CursorZoom/index.ts`
before clearing: `_onPointerDown`, `_pivotOnHoveredSurface`, `DOLLY_SETTLE_MS` and the
`setOrbitPoint` call were all still live, and `smoothTime` was never changed from the vendor's
`0.2`. Its two genuine vendor findings — that `setLookAt` is never clamped, and that
`setOrbitPoint` yanks via `dollyTo` and leaks a focal offset — survive in ADR-0006, which
records the whole five-attempt history of that bug. The rest was a rejected proposal and is
gone with this file.
