# CONTEXT

_Staging buffer for in-flight design decisions (grill-with-docs). Once a
decision is implemented, promote it into its domain guide under `docs/feature/`
(the single source of truth for **how** the thing works) and — when the
alternatives rejected are worth preserving — into an ADR under `docs/adr/`
(the record of **why**). Then clear it from here; this file is never the
permanent record. See `docs/adr/README.md` for the promotion flow._

_No decisions in flight._

Recently promoted (for reference — do not re-stage here):

- **Viewport toolbar — Visibility dropdown group** (shipped `d733b22`) → how it
  works, plus the two-rail geometry, the hand-rolled dropdown idiom, the right
  rail's FX suppression, and the rejected `^` caret affordance:
  `docs/feature/bim-viewer.md` § Viewport toolbars.
- **AR live viewer — glass UI restyle + opacity slider** (shipped `9b255d6`) →
  how it works: `docs/feature/ar-webxr.md`; why, with rejected alternatives:
  `docs/adr/0001-ar-overlay-model-opacity.md`.
